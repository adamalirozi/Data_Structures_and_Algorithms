# Data Structures and Algorithms: 50 Days Challenge

This repository documents my journey through a comprehensive 50-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge. The goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving and master core algorithmic concepts using **Python**.

## 🎯 Objective
Developing the problem-solving ability to solve new and complex problems through consistent practice.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized by data structures and algorithmic topics as outlined in the curriculum:

- ├── 01_Arrays/
- ├── 02_Strings/
- ├── 03_Recursion/
- ├── 04_Hashing/
- ├── 05_Matrices/
- ├── 06_Linked_Lists/
- ├── 07_Stacks_and_Queues/
- ├── 08_Trees_and_BST/
- ├── 09_Tries/
- ├── 10_Heaps/
- ├── 11_Graphs/
- └── 12_Dynamic_Programming/
